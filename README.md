What is TermI?

TermI is a project designed to open applications with shortcuts rather than typing in tedious command lines.

Note:
TermI is currently in alpha testing.

UPDATE DECEMBER 13 2021 (mon)!
Whats new?
1. Changed txt files to .data files to hopefully encrypt where the username and password's are stored.
2. Added TermI logo to setup python file.
3. Putted all the other .py files in a ignore folder to get the termi folder look less cluttery.
4. Added install commands for both cmatrix and links. For example if cmatrix isn't installed then it will install it for you depending on what linux distro you are on!
